    "- What works the best is in fact quite simple. We lowercase and remove punctuation from all video games names, titles and tags, and then we start by looking if a game name is entirely contained in the video title. If it is, we assign the video to this game. If it is not, we look if a game name is entirely contained in one of the tags. If there is only one game name, we assign the video to this game. Otherwise, if there is no game or several games in the tags, we do not assign the video. This way, we can assign a game to **~50%** of the videos.\n",
